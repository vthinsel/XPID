Version 3.0
-----------
* Updates: 
- variables stored in EEPROM. Upon first start, defautl values will be written to EEPROM.
- LCD management to display motors request, position, xpid. LCD refresh controlled by PIN 11. LCD updates require many cycles, decreasing reactivity of sim.
- Sabertooth on pin 3
* To Do:
- Keypad management to update variables and EEPROM content
* Issues:
- 

Version 3.01
------------
* Updates: 
- Added DeadZone and ReadAnalog in EEPROM
- smart upgrade of EEPROM content based on #define VERSION <version> which is writtena at address 0 of EEPROM

Version 3.02
------------
* Updates: 
- Bugfix
- LCD update: display version info on boot and EEPROM upgrade info
  
Version 3.04
------------
* Updates: 
- strings moved to flash to save memory
- working menu and keypad
* To Do:
- Implement menus actions to update variables
  
Version 3.05
------------
* Updates: 
- #define DEBUG added to make code lighter when not debugging over serial port. comment it for production
- LCD now displays the ms required to run a loop. With LCD: 13ms required. without LCD:3ms- functions re-organized
- Code cleanup, added comments
* To Do:
- Implement menus actions to update variables

Version 3.06
------------
* Updates: 
- Code compatible with mega2560. Uses serial for simengine and serial1 for sabertooth for adruino mega.
- Added sabertooth type in EEPROM (1=25*2,2=32*2)
- LCDChangeValInt created to update variable using LCD keypad (needs more tests)
- bug fixes in display
* To Do:
- Test menus actions to update variables

Version 3.07
------------
* Updates: 
- Added in EEPROM standby values for M1 and M2
- Keypad fixes. BAcklight management (compatible with v1 & v2 shield)
- Bugfixes in menu navigation
- Swith to packet serial for more reliable/fast sabertooth management
- Sabertooth speed set to 115200 if 2*32, 38400 otherwise
- Serial speed to 115200 if mega260, 19200 with arduino UNO

bug fixes in display
* To Do:
- improve serial speed depending on UNO/2560 and 2*23/2*25 (not optimal as of today as UNO+2*32 => 19200 )
- Test menus actions to update variables
- Missing double/float eidting through LCD

Version 3.09
------------
* Updates: 
- Sabertooth model selectable through LCD
- Debug on serial TX2 for mega2560 at 115200 no matter the #define DEBUG statement
- Sabertooth on serial TX1 for mega 2560 at 115200
- SimEngine at 115200 onUSB/serial connection on MEga2560
- Reset EEPROM added in menu, in order to force default values in case of fresh install/failed upgrade
bug fixes in display
* To Do:
- Final tests once sabertooth 2*32 becomes available


Version 3.10
------------
* Updates: 
- Refactored some PID/output functions
- Removed CalculateMotorDirection(): merged and optimized in SetPWM
- Optimized SetPWM, with better deadzone management
- Changed debug display of current var
- some bugfixes
bug fixes in display
* To Do:
- optimize further the PID code


Version 3.11
------------
* Updates: 
- Code cleanup and few bugfixes
- Added license
- Version released to XSim community
bug fixes in display
* To Do:
- optimize further the PID code

Version 3.12
------------
* Updates: 
- Changing pot min/max and standby value using LCD makes the motors move to the new position for 3 seconds to test the value.
- LCD refresh every 100ms : more readable, less CPU usage for LCD = more CPU available for XPID calculation.
- removed FASTADC trick : better conversion with much less noise. As a consequence, no need to read n times and make an average when using FASTADC.
* To Do:

Version 3.13
------------
* Updates:
- FASTADC is back
- Implemented a class for motors : code simplification
- PID calculation in one step

Version 3.14
------------
* Updates:
- LCD replaced by TFT with touchscreen
